# Computation_practices
In the main repository folder, make a README.md file and include links to a short video (10-30 seconds) of each sketch running. No editing, narration or subtitles is necessary.
Select one exercise and develop it further on your own, and mark it clearly in the README file. It can be one of the weekly folders or a new sketch based on a task from class. 
For submission, only include a link to your GitHub repository. It should be in a .pdf, .docx, .odt or .txt. Do NOT upload MacOS-native files (e.g. .pages).
